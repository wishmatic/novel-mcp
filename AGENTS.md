# AGENTS.md

## General Flow

- Do the work first. Don't research in depth, or really at all.
- Did it work? Even if it did, now verify your method, including research.
- Iterate repeatedly, biasing to doing work first before verifying.
- Then, in a polish phase, _then_ you can do a lot more research to ensure you did the right thing.

Do not make the user wait for a long research period. Allow making the codebase broken temporarily,
and allow making exploratory mistakes so long as they're cleaned up later.

Do not read any external files such as module code until you've thoroughly read the internal code
first.

Never "double check the diff" or read git status, git history, unless you have a really good reason.

Always assume the user is working in the same space as you.

## PLAN.md files

Any "large" work needs an all-caps `_PLAN.md` suffixed file in `docs/plans`. "Large" is defined as
anything that has more than two implementation units. An implementation unit is a self-contained
piece of work that has clear review signals and is usually what would be implemented as one pull
request. However, do not commit, create pull requests, or do any `git` write operations without
explicit instructions.

When making changes, you must always read the plans first. You may need to update them. Do not
update `docs/plans/done` however, as these files are historical record and can be deleted at any
time. You may read them when you believe them to be relevant. Use done plans as secondary reference
for how to create new plans if this `AGENTS.md` file does not specify updated ways to do the same
thing.

Plan documents must have implementation units that are self-contained and could be reviewable by
themselves and make sense to do so. Each must have verifiable, specific, and complete acceptance
criteria, focusing on correctness. Make consideration of non-functional requirements such as
security, performance, and maintainability, and look for ways to test everything for confidence.
Some tests will need to be completed by the human; mark where this is the case.

Move plans to done when they are done, even without full human verification completed. When AC are
finished, you must also mark those too as complete.

## Tool Calls

Do not needlessly call `git` commands just to check history. Only when absolutely necessary.

## Output

Do not give caveats unless they are actually caveats. Err on the side of not presenting them; only
if they are actually something you expect the user will face in the future. For example, if the user
asked you to parse URLs that go to an img2img call to match upstream URLs, do not give a caveat
saying this will not work for other URLs.

Do not remind the user what you've done after you've done it unless they ask; they can see the diff.

## Callables

Functions/methods should be kept short unless doing so would make the code less maintainable/harder
to read. "Short" means "fewer than 100 lines of code" and ideally fewer than 30 lines of code. Do
not over-optimise for this.

## Organization

Agents should feel encouraged to break up files into smaller, more focused units with corresponding
test files. When necessary and beneficial to break up a package where certain parts of it are
isolated/only small amounts of the API need to be used within the package, do so: create new
packages.

A file is considered "very long" at 300 lines of code or more. It is considered "unacceptably long"
at 500 or more. Do not over-optimise, but if a file can be broken up and split into smaller, more
focused units, do so at roughly 200+ lines of code, and even if it might influence readability, do
so at unacceptably long files.

## Architecture

Arrows point from a package to the packages it imports. Only `internal/server` may import
`internal/mcp`; the libraries below it must not import `internal/mcp` or the MCP SDK, except
`internal/present`, which is the presentation layer for MCP content: it may import the SDK, but
never `internal/mcp`. `internal/utils` and `internal/sourcemap` are the shared leaves and must stay
dependency-free.

If you make changes to the architecture, update this diagram.

    mcp["internal/mcp"]
    present["internal/present"]
    format["internal/format"]
    novelai["internal/novelai"]
    resolve["internal/resolve"]
    store["internal/store"]
    sourcemap["internal/sourcemap"]
    utils["internal/utils"]

    mcp --> novelai
    mcp --> present
    mcp --> format
    mcp --> resolve
    mcp --> store

    store --> format
    present --> format

    novelai --> format
    novelai --> utils
    resolve --> sourcemap
    resolve --> utils
```

`cmd/server`, `internal/server`, and `internal/config` are deliberately left out of the diagram:
they are wiring and config plumbing, so every edge they own is expected rather than a constraint
worth drawing. `internal/auth` is omitted too: it has no internal edges.

## Comments and Docstrings

Do not add comments nor docstrings unless they document something that the code itself does not
document. You should write self-documenting code, which may include making variables and functions,
for instance, slightly more verbose than you would otherwise write. The most useful comments are
"why" something is the way it is.

E.g., a docstring should _not_ be added if all it does is describe what its parameters do.

Bias _heavily_ against adding comments and docstring. Comments/docstrings should be necessary only.
Test files should almost never have any comments.

When writing comments, be as succinct as possible. Prefer docstrings to comments when possible.

Comments (not docstrings) should have a newline between it and the code it is commenting on.

Do not use em-dashes. Use a semicolon, colon, or hyphen instead.

Line length limit is not 80 characters for code and comments/docstrings; use 100 characters. If
lines cannot be shorter than 100 characters without making them harder to read, don't shorten them.

## README.md

The README.md should be very high level and, importantly, short. APIdoc, if present, should be used
to provide more detailed information, not the README.md.

## Niche Rules

There must be a space between any ending curly braces by themselves on a line and returns. E.g.,

```go
// bad:

  // ...
}
return nil;

// good:

  // ...
}

return nil
```
